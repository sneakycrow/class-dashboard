A dashboard system for taking classes

_Note from the Author_: Right now, this project doesn't serve any one but me real purpose. I'm more doing it to just test myself and also play with some new tools and packages. Feel free to explore and ask questions. But **I would not recommend this to be used as an actual dashboard**.
